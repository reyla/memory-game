### Background

This project was part of the Front End Web Development nanodegree course from udacity.


### Description

This is a basic memory card-matching game where the user can flip over cards to see if they match. A matched pair stays open and an unmatched pair flips back over. The game is won when all the cards have been matched.

Game elements:
* timer that tracks the length of your game
* number of moves counter
* star rating based on number of moves
* modal box that shows stats when a game is won
* refresh icon and replay button to start over

Timer code was based on Chris Neal's tutorial here:
