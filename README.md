### Background

This project was part of the Front End Web Development nanodegree course from udacity.


### Description

This is a basic memory card-matching game where the user can flip over cards to see if they match. A matched pair stays open and an unmatched pair flips back over. The game is won when all the cards have been matched.


### Game Features

* timer that tracks the length of your game
* number of moves counter
* star rating based on number of moves
* modal box that shows stats when a game is won
* refresh icon and replay button to start over


### How To Play

1. The goal is to find cards with matching icons and match all of the cards in the deck. There are 16 cards so there are 8 matches to make.
2. Click on the blue rectangular "cards" to open the card and view the icon for that card. The timer starts once you click on the first card of a game. 
3. You can open two cards at a time. If the two cards match, they will remain open. Otherwise, they will flip back over.
4. Each pair of opened cards counts as one move. Your star rating will decrease with the number of moves taken.
5. Once all cards are matched, the game is won. You will see a modal pop-up that shows your Time, Star Rating, and Number of Moves taken.
6. You can use the "Play again" button on the pop-up to start a new game, or you can use the refresh icon on the game board to play a new game.
